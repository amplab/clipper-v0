# liblinear-sys generates some intermediate files
# that don't sit in /target and thus don't get cleaned
# with cargo clean. If you install cargo-cln
# (cargo install cargo-cln) this additional metadata will
# clean it. This is only for sanitary reasons, it will be
# cleaned and rebuilt at the appropriate optimization level
# with every invocation of cargo build.
