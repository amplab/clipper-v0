### Clipper: Low-latency, online prediction serving and model management

This codebase contains an experimental prototype version of the Clipper
prediction-serving system written in Rust.

This work was presented at NSDI 2017. You can find the [paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi17/nsdi17-crankshaw.pdf) and [presentation](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi17/technical-sessions/presentation/crankshaw). The performance numbers reported in the NSDI paper were achieved with this system.
